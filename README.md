# QTC: QGIS Time of Concentration

This plugin allows the user to interactively calculate the hydrologic time of concentration along a line/polyline.

When the plugin is launched, a dialog is opened allowing the user to enter the following parameters:

- raster to be sampled for elevations
- minimum allowable slope
- minimum total TC (can be left blank)
- text file save location (can be left blank)
- subbasin name (can be left blank)
- whether to save the above parameters as defaults

After clicking Ok, the dialog is closed and the user is prompted to select a line/polyline feature.
